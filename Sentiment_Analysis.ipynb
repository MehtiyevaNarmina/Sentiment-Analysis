      "the rear megapixel camera has a f aperture with pdaf autofocus was decently quick in good light theres autohdr which did a good job of balancing the exposure in our experience we observed good detail in landscape shots in daylight and colours were pleasing too the main sensor stumbled a bit with macros as it simply wasnt able to resolve finer detail the white balance was a bit of a hit or a miss in closeups and we often found ourselves having to taptofocus to get the white balance back on track saving hdr images takes a good couple of seconds in daylight i would be very happy if they have provided the flash in portrait mode still you can tap on torch icon to switch on the torch you will get the flash in portrait mode\n",

      "battery in redmi  pro\n",
      "battery life is one of the strong suits of the redmi  pro the mah battery easily lasted us a full day and a bit more on one charge playing heavy games didnt drain the battery too much either in a single round of pubg around  minutes in which we survived till the very end we recorded a drop of around seven percent which is not bad in our internal video loop test we got a runtime of  hours and  minutes which is very good the redmi  pro doesnt support fast charging but the bundled w adapter gave us roughly a  percent charge in an hour and it took us roughly  hours and  minutes to charge it completely from zero\n",
      "well before buying this phone i have heard many issues regarding inbuilt advertisement in xiaomi devices and i checked that too in my previous xiaomi phone which i am using since  years and actually i found inbuilt ads in those phones you will see ads in inbuilt developers apps like mi apps mi music mi videos security file manager themes sometimes you will see fullscreen ads which are really irritating for mi fans but there is a cooler way to stop those ads those who wanted to know contact me\n",
